### Step 4: Get Your Connection Details
1. Go to **Project Settings** → **API**

   - **Project URL** (starts with `https://`)
   - **API Key** (anon/public key)

### Step 5: Update Environment Variables

```bash
# Replace these with your actual Supabase credentials

```

### Step 6: Test Connection

2. Go to the dashboard
3. Look at the **Database Status** panel in the sidebar
4. It should show "Connected to Supabase database" with a green cloud icon

## ✅ Verification

After setup, your app will:

- **Store all processed documents** in Supabase database
- **Sync across devices** (if you add auth later)
- **Work offline** (falls back to localStorage automatically)
- **Show connection status** in the dashboard sidebar

## 🔄 Fallback Behavior

The app is designed to be resilient:

- **✅ Supabase available**: Documents stored in cloud database
- **⚠️ Supabase unavailable**: Automatically falls back to localStorage
- **🔄 Connection restored**: Can sync localStorage data to Supabase later

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

| Feature | Supabase Free Tier | Your Cost |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|

| API Requests | 50,000/month | **$0** |
| Realtime Connections | 200 concurrent | **$0** |
| **Total Monthly Cost** | | **$0.00** |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Failed to connect to Supabase"
- Check your `.env.local` file has correct URL and key
- Verify the project is active in Supabase dashboard
- Try restarting the development server

### "Table does not exist"
- Make sure you ran the SQL schema from `supabase-schema.sql`
- Check the SQL Editor for any errors
- Verify all tables were created in the Table Editor

### "Row Level Security policy violation"
- The demo uses `demo-user` as user ID
- In production, integrate with proper authentication
- For testing, you can temporarily disable RLS

1. **Test document processing** - Upload files and verify they appear in Supabase
2. **Add authentication** - Integrate with Supabase Auth for multi-user support  
3. **Enable real-time** - Get live updates when documents are processed
4. **Scale up** - Upgrade to Pro when you need more storage/bandwidth
