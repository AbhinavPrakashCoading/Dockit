# 🎨 Real Logo Integration - Updated

## ✅ **Integration Ready for Your Actual Logo**

I've updated the DocKit logo integration to use your **actual logo files** instead of generic placeholders.

### 📁 **File Locations**

Your beautiful purple gradient logo should be saved as:

```
public/logos/main/
├── dockit-icon.png      ← Save your logo here (main file)
└── dockit-logo-full.png ← Save your logo here (backup)
```

### 🎯 **Your Logo Design**

From the attachment, I can see your logo features:
- **Stylized "d"** - Perfect for DocKit branding
- **Document/User Icon** - Represents document intelligence
- **Purple Gradient** - Matches the app theme perfectly
- **Modern Design** - Professional and clean

### 🔧 **Updated Components**

1. **DockitLogo Component**: Now looks for your actual PNG files
2. **Dashboard Sidebar**: Will display your real logo once saved
3. **Fallback System**: Shows "D" in purple gradient if files are missing

### 📝 **To Activate Your Logo**

1. Right-click your logo image from the attachment
2. Save as `dockit-icon.png` in the `public/logos/main/` folder
3. Your logo will immediately appear in the dashboard!

### ✨ **Why Your Logo is Perfect**

- **Brand Alignment**: The "d" represents DocKit perfectly
- **Color Harmony**: Purple gradient matches the existing UI
- **Professional**: Conveys trust and intelligence
- **Memorable**: Distinctive design for brand recognition

Once you save your actual logo file, it will replace any placeholder and give DocKit its true brand identity! 🚀
