## 🔧 Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Core authentication service
   - Implement AuthService with JWT tokens
   - Create basic API routes
   - Set up secure token storage

2. **Phase 2**: UI Components
   - Build modern auth forms with Shadcn/UI
   - Implement form validation
   - Add loading and error states

3. **Phase 3**: Advanced Features
   - Add OAuth providers
   - Implement MFA
   - Add email verification

4. **Phase 4**: Security & Testing
   - Add rate limiting
   - Implement comprehensive tests
   - Security audit and hardening

## 🚀 Migration Plan

Once this system is implemented:
1. Update all auth buttons to use new components
2. Migrate user data from current system
3. Update API endpoints to use new auth service
4. Remove old NextAuth.js implementation
5. Update Vercel environment variables

## 📝 Notes

- Designed to be framework-agnostic (easily portable)
- Focus on security best practices
- Modern UX patterns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Built for scalability
