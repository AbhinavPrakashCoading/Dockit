# Cloud-First Document Storage System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a privacy-first, cloud-centric document storage system that provides different experiences for authenticated users (Google Drive storage) and guest users (local-only storage). The system maintains the three-tier storage protocol with AI/ML enhancements while ensuring no server-side document persistence.

## Architecture Summary

### Core Components

#### 1. Google Drive Storage Service (`GoogleDriveStorageService.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Handles authenticated user document storage in their personal Google Drive
- **Features**:
  - OAuth2 integration with Google Drive API
  - Automatic folder structure creation (`ExamDoc Documents/Archives/Masters/ZIPs`)
  - File upload/download/delete operations
  - Drive quota management
  - Token refresh handling

#### 2. Guest Storage Service (`GuestStorageService.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Manages local-only storage for anonymous users
- **Features**:
  - Temporary session-based storage (24-hour expiration)
  - File size limits (50MB per file, 200MB total)
  - Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
  - No server persistence - pure local storage
  - Security checks to prevent path traversal

#### 3. Document Storage Service (`DocumentStorageService.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Main orchestrator handling both cloud and local storage workflows
- **Features**:
  - Three-tier processing (Archive → Master → ZIP)
  - AI/ML enhancement pipeline integration
  - Unified API for authenticated and guest users
  - Schema-compliant ZIP package creation

#### 4. Encryption Service (`EncryptionService.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Field-level encryption for sensitive personal data
- **Features**:
  - AES-256-CBC encryption for personal data
  - Development-friendly fallback behavior
  - Object field encryption/decryption
  - Search hash generation for encrypted data queries

#### 5. Document Enhancement Pipeline (`DocumentEnhancementPipeline.ts`)
- **Purpose**: AI/ML processing using free/open-source tools
- **Features**:
  - Image upscaling with ESRGAN
  - OCR text extraction with Tesseract
  - Face detection with OpenCV/MediaPipe
  - PDF optimization with Ghostscript
  - Quality assessment and improvement metrics

## Database Schema Evolution

### Updated Prisma Models

```prisma
model User {
  // Google Drive Integration
  googleDriveToken    String?   // OAuth access token
  googleDriveRefresh  String?   // OAuth refresh token
  driveRootFolderId   String?   // User's ExamDoc folder ID
  
  // Encrypted personal data (handled at app level)
  rollNumber    String?
  fullName      String?
}

model DocumentArchive {
  // Cloud storage fields
  driveFileId   String?   // Google Drive file ID
  drivePath     String?   // Path in user's Drive
  storageType   StorageType // 'cloud' or 'local'
  
  // Encrypted fields (handled at app level)
  filename      String    // Original filename
}

model DocumentMaster {
  // AI enhancement results
  textExtracted     String?  // OCR extracted text
  documentAnalysis  String?  // JSON analysis results
  faceDetected      Boolean
  
  // Cloud storage fields
  driveFileId   String?
  drivePath     String?
  storageType   StorageType
}

model DocumentZip {
  // Schema compliance
  includedDocuments String  // JSON array of document IDs
  rollNumber        String? // Associated roll number
  
  // Cloud storage fields
  driveFileId   String?
  drivePath     String?
  storageType   StorageType
}
```

## API Architecture

### Storage Endpoints

#### Guest Storage API (`/api/storage/guest`)
- `POST /api/storage/guest` - Initialize guest session
- `GET /api/storage/guest/[sessionId]` - Get session info
- `DELETE /api/storage/guest/[sessionId]` - Clear session

#### Enhanced Upload Hook (`useEnhancedUpload.ts`)
- Unified upload interface for authenticated and guest users
- Progress tracking through processing stages
- Automatic session management for guests
- ZIP package creation workflow

## Privacy & Security Features

### 1. Data Encryption
- Field-level encryption for all personal data
- Names, emails, roll numbers encrypted before database storage
- Search-friendly hash generation for encrypted fields
- Development-mode fallbacks to prevent data loss

### 2. Cloud Privacy
- **Authenticated Users**: All documents stored in user's personal Google Drive
- **Guest Users**: Zero server persistence - all data local/temporary
- No document content ever stored on application servers
- OAuth tokens encrypted in database

### 3. Session Security
- Guest sessions auto-expire after 24 hours
- Secure random session ID generation
- Path traversal protection for file access
- Storage quota enforcement

## Three-Tier Storage Protocol

### Tier 3: Archives (Exact Copies)
- **Purpose**: Failsafe backup of original uploaded files
- **Storage**: Google Drive `/Archives` folder or local temp storage
- **Features**: Checksums, original metadata preservation

### Tier 1: Masters (AI/ML Enhanced)
- **Purpose**: High-quality AI-processed versions for submission
- **Processing**: ESRGAN upscaling, OCR extraction, face detection
- **Storage**: Google Drive `/Masters` folder or local temp storage
- **Metadata**: Enhancement type, quality scores, analysis results

### Tier 2: ZIPs (Schema-Compliant Packages)
- **Purpose**: Exam-ready submission packages
- **Contents**: Enhanced documents + schema files + metadata
- **Validation**: Schema compliance checking
- **Storage**: Google Drive `/ZIPs` folder or local temp storage

## AI/ML Enhancement Pipeline

### Free Tools Integration
1. **ESRGAN**: Image super-resolution for document quality improvement
2. **Tesseract OCR**: Text extraction from document images
3. **OpenCV**: Computer vision for document analysis
4. **MediaPipe**: Face detection for identity verification
5. **Sharp**: Built-in image processing and optimization
6. **Ghostscript**: PDF processing and compression

### Processing Workflow
```
Upload → Archive → Enhance → Analyze → Package → Store
    ↓        ↓         ↓        ↓         ↓       ↓
  Original  Exact    AI/ML   Extract   Schema  Drive/Local
    File    Copy   Enhanced  Analysis   ZIP    Storage
```

## User Experience Flows

### Authenticated User Flow
1. Login with OAuth (Google/GitHub/etc.)
2. Connect Google Drive (one-time setup)
3. Upload documents → Stored in personal Drive
4. AI enhancement → Enhanced versions in Drive
5. Create exam packages → ZIP files in Drive
6. Download/share via Drive sharing permissions

### Guest User Flow
1. Anonymous access - no registration required
2. Initialize temporary local session (24h expiry)
3. Upload documents → Stored in local temp directory
4. AI enhancement → Enhanced versions locally
5. Create exam packages → ZIP files locally
6. Download immediately (no persistence after session)
