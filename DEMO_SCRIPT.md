## ðŸŽ¬ Script Timeline

### 00:00 - 00:15 | Introduction (15s)
"Hi everyone! Today I'm demoing our Phase 1 Schema Generation Engine. This tool automatically generates validation schemas from exam form PDFs. Let's see it in action with a NEET application form."

**Action:**
- Show schema-gen page loaded
- Highlight the interface elements

---

### 00:15 - 00:45 | Schema Generation (30s)
"I'll start by entering 'NEET' as the exam form and clicking Generate."

**Action:**
- Type "NEET" in the exam form input field
- Click "Generate Schema" button
- Show the loading state/progress indicator

"Watch as the system processes the document, extracts fields, and infers validation rules..."

**Action:**
- Wait for generation to complete
- Show the generated schema appearing

"And there we go! In under 30 seconds, we have a complete schema with 96% field coverage."

---

### 00:45 - 01:15 | Stepper Flow Navigation (30s)
"The interface uses a stepper to organize fields by category. Let's navigate through them."

**Action:**
- Click through stepper steps: Personal Info â†’ Academic Details â†’ Contact

### 01:15 - 01:40 | Live Editing Demo (25s)
"Now let's make an edit. I'll modify the phone pattern to support international format."

**Action:**
- Click on a phone field
- Show the edit interface/modal
- Change pattern from `^[0-9]{10}$` to `^\\+?[0-9]{10,15}$`
- Save the change

"Notice how the change auto-saves to IndexedDB for persistence."

**Action:**
